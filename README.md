# Analyze MovieLens data

## Project Description

I set up a standalone single node cluster in Hadoop to utilize YARN and HDFS to perform Apache Hive queries through a CLI application to analyze data from a Movie-lens dataset.
## Technologies Used

* Hadoop - version 2.7.3.2.6.5.0-292
* HDFS - version 2.7.3.2.6.5.0-292
* Hive - version 2.6.5.0-292

## Features

List of features ready and TODOs for future development
* using this project some query are solved using hiveQL following query are listed below:

* 01. first 5 entries from movies table
* 02. number of unique movies
* 03. summary of ratings data
* 04. minimum rating given to a movie
* 05. maximum rating given to a movie
* 06. is any row null in tags
* 07. number of unique tags
